This can include hormone therapy, medications to prevent or treat osteoporosis, low-dose antidepressants for hot flashes, medications to reduce hot flashes, and vaginal estrogen.\\n\\nWhen to call a doctor:\\nIf you're experiencing symptoms that interfere with your life or well-being, such as hot flashes, mood swings, or changes in sexual function that concern you, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. Also, if your periods stop before age 40, or if you're still having periods in your 50s, you should see a doctor.\\n-----------\", \"prompt\\n-----------\\nWhat is Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\\n-----------\\n\\nresponse\\n-----------\\nIntroduction:\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs.\\n\\nSymptoms:\\nThe symptoms of PCOS can vary, but they typically include irregular periods, heavy bleeding, excess hair growth, acne, weight gain, male-pattern baldness, darkening of the skin, and headaches.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nWhile there's no cure for PCOS, the symptoms can be managed. Treatment options can include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to control symptoms, and procedures to help with fertility if you're trying to become pregnant.\\n\\nWhen to call a doctor:\\nIf you have symptoms of PCOS, it's important to seek medical advice. Early diagnosis and treatment can help control the symptoms and prevent long-term complications, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\\n-----------\", \"prompt\\n-----------\\nWhat is a Urinary tract infection (UTI)?\\n-----------\\n\\nresponse\\n-----------\\nIntroduction:\\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of your urinary system — your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra. Women are at greater risk of developing a UTI than are men.\\n\\nSymptoms:\\nUTI symptoms can include a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation when urinating, passing frequent, small amounts of urine, urine that appears cloudy, urine that appears red, bright pink or cola-colored — a sign of blood in the urine, and strong-smelling urine.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nAntibiotics are the first line of treatment for urinary tract infections. Which drugs are prescribed and for how long depend on your health condition and the type of bacteria found in your urine.\\n\\nWhen to call a doctor:\\nIf you have symptoms of a UTI, it's important to seek medical attention. If left untreated, a UTI can lead to more serious complications, such as a kidney infection. If you're experiencing severe pain, high fever, or blood in your urine, it's important to seek immediate medical attention.\\n-----------\", \"prompt\\n-----------\\nWhat are Uterine Fibroids?\\n-----------\\n\\nresponse\\n-----------\\nIntroduction:\\nUterine fibroids are noncancerous growths of the uterus that often appear during childbearing years. Also known as leiomyomas or myomas, uterine fibroids aren't associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and almost never develop into cancer.\\n\\nSymptoms:\\nMany women with uterine fibroids have no symptoms. However, fibroids can cause a number of symptoms depending on their size, location within the uterus, and how close they are to adjacent pelvic organs. These can include heavy menstrual bleeding, menstrual periods lasting more than a week, pelvic pressure or pain, frequent urination, difficulty emptying the bladder, constipation, and backache or leg pains.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nTreatment for uterine fibroids depends on your symptoms. If you're not bothered by your symptoms, you might decide to receive no treatment at all. If your symptoms are moderate to severe, your doctor may recommend medication or surgery.\\n\\nWhen to call a doctor:\\nIf fibroid symptoms are causing you discomfort or affecting your quality of life, it's important to discuss this with your doctor. If you're experiencing severe vaginal bleeding or sharp pelvic pain that comes on suddenly, seek immediate medical care.\\n-----------\", 'prompt\\n-----------\\nWhat is Breast cancer?\\n-----------\\n\\nresponse\\n-----------\\nIntroduction:\\nBreast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.\\n\\nSymptoms:\\nIn its early stages, breast cancer may not cause any symptoms. In many cases, a tumor may be too small to be felt, but an abnormality can still be seen on a mammogram. If a tumor can be felt, the first sign is usually a new lump in the breast that was not there before. However, not all lumps are cancer. Each type of breast cancer can cause a variety of symptoms. Many of these symptoms are similar, but some can be different. Symptoms for the most common breast cancers include a breast lump or tissue thickening that feels different than surrounding tissue and often does not hurt, skin changes, such as dimpling, a newly inverted nipple, peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple or breast skin, redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nTreatment for breast cancer usually begins with a diagnosis and understanding of your cancer stage. After diagnosing your breast cancer, your doctor works with you to discuss a plan that best suits your cancer type, stage and long-term outlook. Treatment options can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy drugs, and immunotherapy.\\n\\nWhen to call a doctor:\\nIf you find a lump or other change in your breast — even if a recent mammogram was normal — make an appointment with your doctor for prompt evaluation.\\n-----------', \"prompt\\n-----------\\nWhat is a Urinary tract infection (UTI)?\\n-----------\\n\\nresponse\\n-----------\\nIntroduction:\\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of your urinary system — your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.

              "\"Introduction:\\nEarly detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment. In addition to regular mammograms, women should also perform regular breast self-exams to identify any changes in their breasts.\\n\\nSymptoms:\\nSymptoms of breast cancer can include a new lump in the breast or armpit, swelling or thickening of part of the breast, irritation or dimpling of breast skin, redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast, pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area, and changes in the size or the shape of the breast.\\n\\nTreatment:\\nTreatment for breast cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The choice of treatment depends on the type of breast cancer, its stage, and the person's overall health.\\n\\nWhen to call a doctor:\\nIf you notice any changes in your breasts or have any signs or symptoms that worry you, it's important to consult a doctor. Additionally, it's crucial to follow the recommended guidelines for mammograms based on your age and personal health history.\""
