In the United States, the average age for menopause is 51. Menopause is officially diagnosed when a woman has not had a menstrual period for one year.\n\nSymptoms:\nCommon symptoms include irregular periods, lower fertility, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats, disturbed sleep, mood changes, and weight gain.\n\nTreatment:\nTreatments can help manage menopausal symptoms. These may include hormone therapy, vaginal estrogen, low-dose antidepressants, medications to prevent or treat osteoporosis, and lifestyle and home remedies like avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods.\n\nWhen to call a doctor:\nIf you're having symptoms that interfere with your life or well-being, such as hot flashes, mood swings, or changes in sexual function that concern you, it's important to consult a healthcare provider. If you have symptoms such as bleeding after menopause, it's important to seek medical attention as this can be a sign of a serious health problem."}]}
